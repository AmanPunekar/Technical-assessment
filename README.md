Alogorithm
Binary search – implement the binary search algorithm to find the index of a given element in a sorted array. If the element is not present, return -1.
In this program, the array is divided into two arryas by finding middle element.
Then the number to find is compared with middle element. If it is find then it will return index number.
If not it is compared with both the divided arrays and return the index number.
If it is not present in array it will return -1.

Array and String
Merge two Sorted arrays: Write a function that merges two sorted arrays into a single sorted array.
In this program, initially an empty array is declared which will contain merged array.
Two variables are declared which will iterate through the arrays.
Iterate through the arrays using while loop. Elements of both arrays are compared to sort them in order.
Then one while loop for those elements are remaining in first array and one loop for the remaining elements of other loop.
Function will return the merged array.

Dynamic Programming
FizzBuzz: A classic question to test programming logic. Write a program that prints the numbers from 1 to 100. But for multiples of three, print “Fizz” instead of the number, and for the multiples of five, print “Buzz”. For numbers that are multiples of both three and five, print “FizzBuzz”.
In this program, the loop is iterating for 100 times as given in question. 
It will print “FizzBuzz” if the number in the loop is multiple of 3 and 5.
It will print “Fizz” if the number is multiple of 3.
It will print “Buzz” if the number is multiple of 5.

Object-Oriented Programming
Design a simple class hierarchy for a library management system, including classes for books, authors, and library patrons.
In this program Author, Book and Patron and Library, classes are declared containing variables about details of those particular classes. 
Methods are declared to add and remove book and patron from the library.
